### Turning in your assignment

3. Add an optional note to the `commit changes` box.

### Viewing your Grade

After you submit your assignment the autograder will run. This takes some time to complete (usually a few minutes). Once complete you will see a Grade_Report file in your repository. Click on this file to see your grade for the assignment. Make sure your personal information is correctly identified in the grade report. This is how we associate you with your work.

You are allowed to submit assignments multiple times.  Each time you submit the autograder will run and you will see a new Grade_Report file.  Your final grade for the assignment will be the grade for the last Grade_Report file submitted before the deadline.

*Note* Github uses version control and saves a full history of all changes made to the repository. You can view the history of your repository by clicking on the `history` button.  This will show you all the changes you have made to your repository.  You can also view the history of individual files by clicking on the file and then clicking on the `history` button.
